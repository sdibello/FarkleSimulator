# Farkle Simulator Notes

## MVP Notes
    
    1. decide to keep passed or reset
    2. roll & Score ( return all possible score iterations)
    3. farkle detection
    4. decide which score to keep
    5. decide pass / reroll - loop at #2
    6. log score
    7. pass

    1. Enable running with minimal logging to screen
    2. Enable mulitple games in serial ( i.e run 100 games)

    figure out how to store so I can run AI on it.
    End Game - relist players once someone has decided to end the game


## TODO nice to have
    1. Opening score limit
    2. change the way players decide based on  their score, and the highest score.
