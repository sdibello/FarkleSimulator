# FarkleSimulator

## A Simulator for the Game of Farkle. 

This is set up for a varient of the game that only uses 5 dice.  It's a game i Play with my family and I wonder if I can use machine leaning to win more, cause what else is there?  Also, just an excuse to learn a little more about python and machine learning.
